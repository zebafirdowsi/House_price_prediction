#  Housing Regression Model

## Problem Statement - Part I

A US-based housing company, Surprise Housing, aims to enter the Australian market. The company intends to use data analytics to predict the actual value of prospective properties, helping them decide whether to invest. The dataset provided contains information on the sale of houses in Australia.

The company seeks answers to the following questions:
1. Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house?
2. How well do these variables describe the price of a house?
3. Determine the optimal value of lambda for Ridge and Lasso regression.

### Assignment Overview

The assignment is divided into two parts. Part-I is a programming assignment (to be submitted in a Jupyter Notebook), and Part-II includes subjective questions (to be submitted in a PDF file).

### Business Goal

The company aims to build a regression model using regularization to predict the actual value of prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not. The key objectives include identifying significant variables in predicting house prices, understanding the impact of these variables, and determining the optimal values of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

## Problem Statement - Part II

[Assignment Part-II Questions]

### Question 1

- What is the optimal value of alpha for ridge and lasso regression?
- How does doubling the value of alpha impact the model?
- What are the most important predictor variables after the change is implemented?

### Question 2

- Which optimal value of lambda (alpha) will you choose for ridge and lasso regression?
- Why do you choose one over the other?

### Question 3

- After building the model, you realized that the five most important predictor variables in the lasso model are not available in the incoming data.
- Which are the five most important predictor variables now?

### Question 4

- How can you ensure that a model is robust and generalizable?
- What are the implications for the accuracy of the model, and why?

## Model Evaluation Metrics (Part I)

Here are the key metrics for Linear, Ridge, and Lasso Regression models:

|------------------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------|
| R2 Score (Train)       | 0.895374          | 0.896807         | 0.897168         |
| R2 Score (Test)        | -2.378887e+22     | 0.837925         | 0.800893         |
| RSS (Train)            | 12.90044          | 12.723708        | 12.679216        |
| RSS (Test)             | 1.249191e+24      | 8.510815         | 10.455411        |
| MSE (Train)            | 0.01317717        | 0.012997         | 0.012951         |
| MSE (Test)             | 2.974264e+21      | 0.020264         | 0.024894         |
| RMSE (Train)           | 0.1147918         | 0.114003         | 0.113803         |
| RMSE (Test)            | 5.453682e+10      | 0.142351         | 0.157778         |

## Steps Completed in Part I

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:**
   - Loaded necessary libraries.
   - Loaded and explored the dataset.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handled missing values.
   - Encoded categorical variables.
   - Applied feature scaling.

3. **Data Visualization:**
   - Conducted correlation analysis.
   - Used pair plots and scatter plots for visualization.

4. **Train-Test Split:**
   - Divided the data into training and testing sets.

5. **Linear Regression Model:**
   - Imported and trained the Linear Regression model.

6. **Ridge Regression Model:**
   - Tuned hyperparameters (alpha).
   - Trained and evaluated the Ridge Regression model.

7. **Lasso Regression Model:**
   - Tuned hyperparameters (alpha).
   - Trained and evaluated the Lasso Regression model.

## Instructions for Running the Jupyter Notebook

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `house Prediction.ipynb`.
2. Run the cells sequentially to execute the code.

## Conclusion
The Ridge and Lasso Regression models perform significantly better than the Linear Regression model. Key observations:
- Ridge and Lasso models achieved positive R2 scores, indicating better fit.
- Both models demonstrated lower RSS and MSE on the test set, indicating improved predictive performance.
- Ridge and Lasso seem to consider similar features as important predictors.

Based on the evaluation metrics, Ridge and Lasso Regression models show improved performance compared to Linear Regression. Key predictors influencing house prices include GrLivArea, OverallQual, GarageArea, and others. The choice between Ridge and Lasso may depend on specific data characteristics and the importance of feature selection.


## Future Steps

Consider further exploration and fine-tuning of hyperparameters for even better model performance. Evaluate specific features' impact on predictions and explore additional techniques for feature selection.
